    <p>
        I'm an artist at heart who has a love for aesthetics
        and <br>Visual Design (which is why I have more of an affinity
        <br>for Front-End development, as opposed to Back-End.)
        <br>My employment background consists of
        experience in
        <br> Military & Industrial/ Plant Operations. 
        <br>
        <br> My Personal interests & hobbies include:

        <ul>
            <li>Fashion Design/ Jewelry Crafting</li>
            <li>Woodworking</li>
            <li>3D CAD Design/ Engineering</li>
        </ul>
