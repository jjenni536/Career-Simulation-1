        I'm an artist at heart who has a love for aesthetics
        and <br>Visual Design (which is why I have more of an affinity
        <br>for Front-End development, as opposed to Back-End.)
        <br>My employment background consists of
        experience in
        <br> Military & Industrial/ Plant Operations.
