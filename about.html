    <b>Fashion Design/ Jewelry Crafting</b>
        <p>
        I got into fashion design when I 
        was 12 years old. <br>I love Sewing and drafting
        new designs and it's <br>something I will do for the
        rest of my life!

    <b>Woodworking</b>
        <p>
        Woodworking is something I actually started
        during Covid <br>(about 2.5yrs ago). It started as
        something cool to help the time <br>go by faster,
        since the whole world was quarantining indoors. <br>
        As time went on, I slowly started to develop a
        passion for it.

    <b>3D CAD Design/ Architecture</b>
        <p>
        Funny enough, <b>I Flunked 3D CAD Design in
        college</b> but once <br>I taught myself, I really latched
        on and quickly started creating <br> frameworks and designs
        for this housing-community proposal <br>project I've been
        working on. I also use the software to create <br>functional
        & Architectural furniture concepts.
